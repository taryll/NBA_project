NBA_project
==============================


# NBA project (Data Science)

In this project, I will try to predict scoreboard between team matches, 
classification of players position based on some features I will get.
Another thing I think will be interesting is predicting player overall
on NBA 2k (video game), maybe based on their stats now.

## Useful for setup

creating your virtual environment

```bash
    python3 -m venve env
```

activate virtual environment

```bash 
    source env/bin/activate
```


now install ipykernel so you can add a new kernel on your Jupyter Notebook

```bash 
    pip install ipykernel
```

installing your virtual environment kernel

```bash 
    python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=nba_env
```

deactivate your environment

```bash 
    deactivate
```

lists all packages and versions to txt

```bash 
    pip freeze -> requirements.txt
```
